# Meta-Analysis Projects

Welcome to the **Meta-Analysis Projects** repository using R's `metafor` package! This repository contains R scripts for meta-analyses on the association of antiphospholipid antibodies with migraine and dementia patients. The scripts were used to generate forest plots, L'Abbe plots, funnel plots, and other diagnostic visualizations, subgroup analyses (e.g., adults vs pediatrics, gender, migraine with/without aura), for two peer-reviewed papers published in 2017.

## Scripts

### [MetaAnalysis_ForestPlots.R](MetaAnalysis_ForestPlots.R)

This script generates meta-analysis visualizations for two papers:

1. **"Comorbid association of antiphospholipid antibodies and migraine: A systematic review and meta-analysis"**  
   Published in *Autoimmunity Reviews* (PMID: [28279839](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28279839/))  
   This paper investigates the association between antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) and migraine, including subgroup analyses by age, gender, and migraine type 
   (with/without aura).

2. **"Presence of Anticardiolipin Antibodies in Patients with Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"**  
   Published in *Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience* PMID: [28824414](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28824414/)  
   This paper assesses the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies in patients with dementia, using similar meta-analysis techniques.

#### Script Structure

The script is organized into 10 sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the meta-analysis:

- **Section 1: Setup and Package Installation**  
  Installs and loads required packages (`xlsx`, `metafor`, `RColorBrewer`) and sets the base directory for the migraine meta-analysis.

- **Section 2: Forest Plots for Single Antibodies (aCL, B2GP1, LA)**  
  Generates forest plots for anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-Î²2-glycoprotein I (B2GP1), and lupus anticoagulant (LA) antibodies using both random and fixed effects models. 

- **Section 3: Subgroup Analysis - Adults and Pediatrics (aCL, B2GP1, LA)**  
  Performs subgroup analyses for adults and pediatrics, generating forest plots for aCL, B2GP1, and LA antibodies. Includes sensitivity analysis.

- **Section 4: Overall Migraine Meta-Analysis (n=13 Studies)**  
  Conducts a meta-analysis of 13 studies on migraine and aPLs, producing a forest plot with a custom y-axis range.

- **Section 5: Subgroup Analysis - Adults vs Pediatrics (Overall)**  
  Generates forest plots for overall aPLs association in adults and pediatrics, comparing the two groups.

- **Section 6: Subgroup Analysis - Gender**  
  Creates forest plots for female and male subgroups for the association of aPLs with migraine by gender.

- **Section 7: Subgroup Analysis - Migraine with Aura**  
  Produces forest plots for migraine with aura (MwA) for the association with aCL, B2GP1, LA, and overall aPLs.

- **Section 8: Subgroup Analysis - Migraine without Aura**  
  Generates forest plots for migraine without aura (MwoA) for the association with aCL, B2GP1, LA, and overall aPLs.

- **Section 9: Diagnostic Plots (L'Abbe and Funnel Plots)**  
  Creates L'Abbe plots for aCL, B2GP1, and LA, and funnel plots for aCL (including a styled version and a trim-and-fill analysis).

- **Section 10: Publication Bias Tests (Egger's Test)**  
  Performs classical and random/mixed-effects Egger's tests to assess publication bias in the aCL meta-analysis.
